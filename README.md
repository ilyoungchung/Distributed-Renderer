# Distributed-Renderer
## University of Pennsylvania, CIS 565: GPU Programming and Architecture, FINAL PROJECT

### Team : Dome Pongmongkol and Sanchit Garg

Note : For the front end client: https://github.com/rpdome/Walnut-FrontEnd

### Project outline

We have implemented a Distributed Renderer. The idea is divide the final image into parts, render parts on different systems and then accumulate the final image on one system. The rendering method be used on the back end is a Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS) based path tracer. TCP is used for communication between the viewer and the renderer.
